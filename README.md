## Goal
The project is about building a responsive e-commerce store using React and the Noroff API. It includes the following features:

### Homepage: 
Displays a list of products with a search bar that filters products as the user types. Clicking a product leads to its individual page.
### Product Page: 
Shows product details, including title, description, image, reviews, and discounted prices if available. An "Add to cart" button adds the item to the cart.
### Cart and Checkout:
Cart Page: Lists products in the cart and shows the total price.
Checkout Page: Completes the order and navigates to a success page.
### Checkout Success Page: 
Confirms the order and provides a link to return to the store, clearing the cart.
### Contact Page: 
A form with validation for name, subject, email, and message fields.
### Layout Component: 
Integrates a header, navigation with a cart icon showing item count, and a footer for consistent layout across pages.
### React Router:
Manages navigation between pages with dynamic segments for products.<br/>
<br/>
The design should be responsive, clean, and use CSS frameworks or styled-components as needed. The code is expected to be well-formatted and organized.
